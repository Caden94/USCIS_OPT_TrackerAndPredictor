# USCIS_OPT_TrackerAndPredictor
This is a very simple OPT case Tracking and Predciting project made within a few hours.

There are lots of sections could be improved especielly in the modeling section. Welcome to any suggesitons and hope everyone is able to get the EAD card and start working on time.

# Intuition
I don't wanna change the orietation day twice. 

# P.S
Please make sure you sign all of the documents before you send them to the USCIS. I saw someone was rejected because of unsigned document.
